## Description
This application creates api routes for a social media application website using mongoDB. The following routes were created: getAllUsers, getUserById,  createUser, deleteUser, addFriend, deleteFriend, getAllThought, addThought, getThoughtById, updateThought, removeThought, addReaction, and removeReaction.

I learned about MongoDB in creating this application.
